# Landslide-Risk-Assessment-in-Italy-Integrating-Meteorological-Geological-and-Climatic-Data
This project develops a model to assess landslide risk across Italian slope units by integrating meteorological, soil moisture, and lithotype data. The dataset will help evaluate landslide susceptibility for each unit, supporting risk mitigation and informed land-use planning.
